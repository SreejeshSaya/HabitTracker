# Habit Tracker

About 80% of people leave their New Year’s resolution within 8 weeks. Yes… It’s hard to make habits, because we have adapted to the habits we currently have. This is because we are our own biggest hurdle when it comes to change. 
We tend to do things better when it is tracked. It has been repeatedly proven that us humans show a lot of motivation when we see progress. Visualizing progress is the feedback to us. We love feedback. It’s a way for us to evolve.
So, if we wanted to integrate a certain habit into our lives, we would need some kind of tracker system. A system that would help visualize the progress of a habit over time. 
Enter HabitTracker
Habit tracker is a web application which can be used to visualize habits one would want to grow. 
Users can create new habits they want to learn and view their progress until they learn the habit.  Users can also see how other users are performing on their habits since it is important to have a community who are also trying to make new habits. This web application will help users stick to their schedule by having a support the drive to their goals.

## Intelligent Component
The intelligent component we have integrated in the project is the recommending system. 
Using the most used tags on the website by all users and the past history of the specific user, we recommend a tag that aligns with the user's interest and which is also popular.
When creating a habit, the user can click on the ‘Feeling Lucky’ button which recommends the user a habit he/she might be interested in based on the previous habit history of the user and the current trend.
The tag is automatically chosen according to the habit recommended.
